For downloading and processing data from the New Zealand Geotechnical Database (NZGD).

For organising NZGD records by region, city, and suburb, we used shapefiles from 
Land Information New Zealand (LINZ). The highest level comes from 
https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/50785-nz-land-districts/ and the middle and 
lowest levels come from https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/113763-suburb-locality/ 
(which is primarily for suburb but it also includes the city that the suburb is in).
